# Logos MetaLogic Kernel (LMK) — Orthogonal Dual‑Bijection Confluence (ODBC) Formula

> **Purpose:** Authoritative, copy‑pasteable artifact describing the two independent bijections (ETGC and MESH), the commutation constraints, the meta‑bijection, and the Transcendental Locking Mechanism (TLM). Includes plain‑text references to Document 3 subsections for alignment.

## 1) Domains and Symbols

* **Transcendentals (ETG line):** $T = \{\mathrm{EI},\mathrm{AT},\mathrm{OG}\}$
* **Laws of Logic (ETG line):** $L = \{\mathrm{ID},\mathrm{NC},\mathrm{EM}\}$
* **MESH aspects (MESH line):** $M = \{\Sigma,\mathcal{B},\mathcal{M}\}$
  (read as: simultaneity/entanglement, bridge/elimination, mind/closure)
* **Operators (MESH line):** $O = \{\mathrm{SIGN},\mathrm{BRIDGE},\mathrm{MIND}\}$
* **Persons:** $P = \{\mathrm{Father},\mathrm{Son},\mathrm{Spirit}\}$
* **Qualifier (two interdependent systems):** $q = 2$

**Unity/Trinity invariants (both lines):**
$\text{Unity} = 1$, $\text{Trinity} = 3$, $\text{Ratio} = 1/3$.

## 2) Bijections (each line stands alone)

### A) ETGC line (normative admissibility)

A bijection $f: T \to L$ with Unity/Trinity invariants:

$$
U_T = 1,\quad \Theta_L = 3,\quad U_T/\Theta_L = 1/3.
$$

**Reading:** the one (EI+AT+OG in unity) grounds the three distinct laws (ID, NC, EM). Each law depends on the **total** essence; no partial essence suffices.

### B) MESH line (cross‑domain instantiability)

A bijection $g: M \to O$ with the same invariants:

$$
U_M = 1,\quad \Theta_O = 3,\quad U_M/\Theta_O = 1/3.
$$

**Reading:** the one MESH unity presents as three orthogonal aspects that instantiate as SIGN, BRIDGE, and MIND.

---

## 3) Commutation (no ad‑hoc glue)

Provide pairings $\tau: L\to O$, $\kappa: T\to M$, and $\pi: P\to L$, $\rho: P\to O$. Require the squares to commute:

$$
\boxed{\ \tau\circ f = g\circ \kappa\ }\;:\; T\to O,\qquad
\boxed{\ \rho = \tau\circ \pi\ }\;:\; P\to O.
$$

**Reading:** mapping via the Laws equals mapping via the MESH aspects; persona emphases agree with both.

---

## 4) Meta‑Bijection (product mapping)

Define $H: T\times M \to L\times O$ by $H(t,m) = (f(t), g(m))$. Since products of bijections are bijections, **H is bijective**. This yields a **two‑line isomorphism** of the conceptual space under the shared Unity/Trinity invariants.

---

## 5) Transcendental Locking Mechanism (TLM)

**Lock criterion:** TLM returns **LOCKED** iff **all** of the following hold:

1. ETGC line passes (Unity/Trinity invariants true; $f$ bijective; grounding obligations satisfied).
2. MESH line passes (Unity/Trinity invariants true; $g$ bijective; SIGN simultaneity, MIND closure/typing, BRIDGE elimination enforced).
3. Commutation holds (both squares).

Otherwise, TLM returns **NOT LOCKED** with structured reasons. Only **LOCKED** results are admissible for planning/execution/answers; ETGC failures are **quarantined** (explainable, non‑actionable).

---

## 6) Plain‑Language Summary

* **Line‑1 (ETGC):** “Is it admissible in principle?” (exists, true, good, coherent).
* **Line‑2 (MESH):** “Can it be instantiated across domains?” (simultaneous constraints, typed closure, modal impossibility propagation).
* **Commutation:** both lines must say the **same** thing about how elements correspond.
* **TLM:** issues a signed capability token if—and only if—both lines pass and commute.

This is the **Logos MetaLogic Kernel (LMK)**: the computational enforcement of classical logic bound to ETGC and MESH in a triune, commuting structure.

---

## 7) Document 3 Alignment (plain‑text references)

* **Document 3: “Three Pillars Formalization: Axiomatic and Computational Framework.”**

  * **§1 Axiomatic Foundation (MESH Holism):** Core axioms and MESH holism framing.
  * **§2 MIND Operator & closure:** Typing/closure properties used in the MESH line.
  * **§4 SIGN constraints & simultaneity:** Joint, non‑sequential feasibility checks.
  * **§5 Trinitarian Bijective Mapping (Domain‑Synchronized Mappings):** ETGC line, Unity/Trinity invariants, and the bijective structure this artifact mirrors for executable use.
  * **Gödel / PSR / Is–Ought notes (end sections):** External ground strategy, BRIDGE use from mathematical elimination to modal impossibility.

> This artifact is the **computationally executable translation** of the above sections: two independent bijections with shared Unity/Trinity invariants, commuting maps, and a lock that authorizes action only when both lines agree.
