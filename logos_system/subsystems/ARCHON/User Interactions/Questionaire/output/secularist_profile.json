    "Q4": "Act to maximize personal pleasure and minimize suffering, constrained only by social consequences; morality is subjective and culturally defined.",
    "Q5": "Universe emerged from natural processes (e.g., quantum fluctuations); no creator or purpose\u2014just physics over billions of years.",
    "Q6": "Humans are sophisticated animals driven by biological imperatives (survival, reproduction, pleasure); neither fundamentally good nor evil.",
    "Q7": "No inherent purpose; individuals create subjective meaning through relationships, achievements, and positive experiences.",
    "Q8": "Reality is purely physical; consciousness emerges and dies with the body; no gods, souls, or objective morals\u2014just evolved animals seeking pleasure and avoiding pain."
