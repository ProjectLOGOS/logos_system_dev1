  "Section 1: Worldview Foundations": {
    "Q1": "Reality consists of both physical and metaphysical dimensions\u2014material processes and immaterial absolutes like logic, truth, and morality.",
    "Q2": "Truth is that which aligns with reality and begins with logic. If something is illogical, it's incoherent, and thus not true.",
    "Q3": "Virtues and alignment with God's nature are most valuable. Theology and Christian ethics guide what is good.",
    "Q4": "One should act in a Christ-like manner. Moral objectivity is real, rooted in divine standards. Subjective morality collapses into incoherence.",
    "Q5": "The universe began via the Big Bang, initiated by God. Its structure is ordered, beautiful, and governed by laws, which implies divine intention.",
    "Q6": "Humans are made in the image and likeness of God. We begin neutral but inevitably choose evil. We were designed for good.",
    "Q7": "The telos of life is for God to express His attributes through free agents. Humans exist to receive and reflect divine properties.",
    "Q8": "History ends in universal reconciliation. All are eventually redeemed. Eternal punishment is incoherent; salvation is inevitable."
